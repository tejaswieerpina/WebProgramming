<p>College Event Calender</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The college event calendar is a portal on the internet where users can post the event and select events of interest. 
The admin will have authorities to edit or delete the events posted by all the users. The users can see the posts 
posted by other users as well but they can not edit or delete them. The users can see the feedback of the event through comment.
It is developed using PHP.</p>
<p>Intelligent Calculator</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis Calculator takes text as input and generates output in the form of voice and displays it. 
This is developed using ANDROID OS. We used Text to Speech API to convert text into speech.
We worked in a team of four in the project and I played the role of Team Leader.</p>
